// ARMOR-SOLAR - checking GitHub's own releases for a newer firmware and installing it, next to the existing manual upload (web_server.cpp's
// /api/v1/ota): both end up in the same OTA slot through the same esp_ota_* calls, this one just gets its bytes from the Internet instead
// of the panel's own upload. Nothing here replaces the manual path - a board with no Internet route, or a fleet an operator wants to hold
// back, still updates exactly as it always has.
